        I am a Web Developer with a background in technical support engineering.
        I earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of
        Texas at Austin, where I developed skills in TypeScript, Sass, React.js,
        MongoDB and more.

      <p>
        An innovative problem solver passionate about developing new
        technologies, with a focus on mobile-first practices and test-driven
        development. My schooling in 3D modeling and animation have prepared me
        to approach problems with creativity and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each project, my goal is to utilize my skills to their fullest
        potential while challenging myself, so that I learn something new every
        time. I applied my knowledge of React and agile development in a recent
        project where I worked in a team of 5 to develop a component-based MERN
        app that provides a fun way for individuals to see how well they know
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not project planning or developing, I enjoy drawing, soccer,
        reading, or finding new technologies I can learn that will make me a
        better developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m excited to leverage my skills in the future as part of a fast-paced,
        quality-driven team. Reach out to me to chat about our next project via
        my contact page located above!
