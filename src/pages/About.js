                I climbed the steps from technical support and leapt into the world of web development because I wanted to help create something new, with my own two hands, while solving problems and learning something new every day. When I was about 4 years old, my father taught me how to use a computer. We would play Doom, plus some educational games neither of us can remember. Because of this, I quickly fell in love with technology and computer science.

                This led to where I am now: solving technical support problems, programming, and working with others to build new web applications.  Software has nearly limitless potential to solve problems and create new and better experiences online. I want to be a part of learning and shaping that vast, evolving ocean of programming knowledge so that I can create even better websites and applications.
